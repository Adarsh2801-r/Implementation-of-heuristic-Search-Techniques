## Steepest-Ascent Hill Climbing
The steepest-Ascent algorithm is a variation of the simple hill-climbing algorithm. This algorithm examines all the neighbouring nodes of the current state and selects one neighbour node which is closest to the goal state.

**Problem description:** 
A dart board is filled with 12 sectors. Each sector can perform 4 operations, rotate clockwise, rotate
anticlockwise, shift down (till center). Given an initial state (Fig. A), design and implement an efficient
heuristic approach to reach the goal state (Fig B).
